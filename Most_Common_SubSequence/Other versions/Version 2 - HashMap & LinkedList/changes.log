Array type change:
	>using short instead of int for memory optimization

Added HashMap for recursive approach:
	- array (that uses hashing) of linked lists
	> does not allocate O(NxN) memory but its much less
	optimized for memory (each node is 12 bytes, where as an array index is only 2 - 6x less memory efficient for every subproblem value).
	> can be further optimized if the linked lists are replaced with arrays that also use hashing
